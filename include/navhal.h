 *
 * NavHAL is the official hardware abstraction layer (HAL) developed by
 * NavRobotec. It provides a clean, modular, and extensible C interface to
 * abstract peripheral control (such as GPIO, UART, timers) across multiple
 * microcontroller architectures.
 *
 * Include this file in your application to access the full HAL API.
